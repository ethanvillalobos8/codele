# Contributing to Codele

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Codele! It's people like you that make programming so rewarding.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:
- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
- Submit an issue for your intended contribution if one does not already exist.
- Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
- Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

1. **Create a Branch**:
   - Create a new branch from where you want to base your work.
   - Use a clear branch name, such as `feature-add-x` or `bugfix-a`.

2. **Make Your Changes**:
   - Make commits of logical units.
   - Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
   - Write meaningful commit messages.

3. **Testing Your Changes** (Optional):
   - If you've added new functionality and would like to test, please add tests relevant to the new feature or fix.
   - Ensure the test suite passes with your changes if you choose to run tests.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Push your changes to a branch in your fork of the repository.
   - Submit a pull request to the original repository.
   - Clearly describe the problem and solution in the pull request description.
   - Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Reporting Bugs

- **Use GitHub Issues** - I'll be using GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ethanvillalobos8/codele/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Coding Conventions

As long as it's readable its okay, if you want to refactor my current code feel free to. Here are some basic conventions to be aware of:
- Indentation
- Clear variable names
- Comments where necessary
- Follow the language's coding conventions

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project (MIT License).
